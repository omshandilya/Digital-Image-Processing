# Color Channel Visualization in MATLAB

## Overview
This MATLAB script demonstrates basic image processing techniques, focusing on separating and visualizing individual color channels (Red, Green, Blue) from a given image. 

---

## Code Functionality
1. Reads and displays the original image.
2. Extracts and displays grayscale representations of the image.
3. Splits the image into individual RGB color channels.
4. Creates images emphasizing only the Red, Green, or Blue channels.
5. Displays all the channels alongside the original image using a montage.

---

## Requirements
- MATLAB installed with the Image Processing Toolbox.
- An image file (`Bleach-for-desktop.jpg`) placed in the same directory as the script.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the script in MATLAB.
2. Ensure `Bleach-for-desktop.jpg` is in the working directory.
3. Run the script and view the results.

---

## Output
The script generates:
- The original image.
- Grayscale representation of the red channel.
- Images highlighting individual Red, Green, and Blue channels.
- A montage of the color-separated images and the original.

## Example
### Input:
`Bleach-for-desktop.jpg`

### Output:
A montage showcasing the individual RGB channels and the original image.
